## What Does This Script Do?

The script performs the following actions:
1. Install system updates, reboot if necessary, then install dependencies.
2. Download, validate, and extract Bitcoin Core.
3. Set a prune for Bitcoin Core based on the disk free space.
4. Create shortcuts for Bitcoin Core on the desktop and on the "Show Applications" list.
5. Start Bitcoin Core.
6. Prevent the system from sleeping, suspending, and hibernating.
7. While the initial block download proceeds, display relevant info such as the percent synced, blocks left to sync, current chain tip date, and the free disk space remaining.
8. After the initial block download completes, tell the user that the script has finished and end the script.

## Which Files Does This Script Touch?

Before launching Bitcoin Core, this script modifies the following files:
- Any files related to installing system updates and dependencies
- The downloaded Bitcoin Core tarball and validation files in a random `/tmp/` directory:
  - `bitcoin-*-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz`
  - `SHA256SUMS`
  - `SHA256SUMS.asc`
  - `guix.sigs/`
- The validated Bitcoin Core tarball and PGP keys:
  - `~/Downloads/bitcoin-*-x86_64-linux-gnu.tar.gz`
  - `~/Downloads/guix.sigs/`
- The Bitcoin Core tarball extract directory:
  - `~/bitcoin/`
- The Bitcoin Core configuration file:
  - `~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf`
- A shortcut on the desktop and Show Applications menu:
  - `~/Desktop/bitcoin_core.desktop`
